## Overview
This needs to be updated with a brief purpose for having the block diagram.
Things to mention are:
* Power levels: +5VDC is used across the entire circuit
* Sensors: IR Reflective sensor for measuring water tank levels connected to an op amp to increase signal output (primary sensor for project) and a pressure sensor to check for any leaks or other failures in the irrigation system 
* team connections: Power pin is pin 1 and ground pin is pin 8 for each board
* Power source: 9VAC 3A wall mounted power supply
