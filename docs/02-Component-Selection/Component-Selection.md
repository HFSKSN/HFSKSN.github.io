**Choice:** Option 2: SEN0257 Gravity: Analog Water Pressure Sensor

**Rationale:** An industrial pressure transducer designed for microchip use is better suited to our device than non-industrial pressure sensors such as the MPX5010DP-ND because of its larger range and being specifically designed to work with pipes and liquid flow. Despite not being found on Digikey and being more expensive, the SEN0257 sensor is designed for small-scale microcontroller projects and is able to be calibrated according to our device needs, making it the most suitable option for our team.

**Choice:** Option 2: CTX936TR-ND surface mount oscillator

**Rationale:** A clock oscillator is easier to work with because it requires no external circuitry in order to interface with the PSoC. This is particularly important because we are not sure of the electrical characteristics of the PCB, which could affect the oscillation of a crystal. While the shipping speed is slow, according to the website if we order this week it will arrive within 3 weeks.
