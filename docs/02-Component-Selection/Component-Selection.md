**Choice:** Option 2: SEN0257 Gravity: Analog Water Pressure Sensor

**Rationale:** An industrial pressure transducer designed for microchip use is better suited to detect leaks in our device than the non-industrial pressure sensors such as the MPX5010DP-ND because of it having a larger range and being specifically designed to work with pipes and liquid flow. Despite not being found on Digikey and being more expensive, the SEN0257 sensor is designed for small-scale microcontroller projects and is able to be calibrated according to our device needs, making it the most suitable option for our team.

**Water Level Sensor**

**Choice:** Option 1: OPB732 IR Reflective Sensor

**Rationale:** This IR sensor is the most suitable option for detecting water tank level in our device given its inexpensive pricing, simple calibration, and microcontroller-friendly design. Though the component is not waterproof and cannot produce accurate measurements when the light from the built-in LED is reflected on water, our team will be able to overcome these issues by including an external cover for the exposed parts of the component and will use a floating "platform" in the water to allow for the device to measure water levels accurately and at a low price.
