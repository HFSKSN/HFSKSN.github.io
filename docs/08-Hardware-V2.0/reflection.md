If I were to create a second version of the design with more time and resources, I would have added more sensors to the subsystem as well as improved the code for my primary and secondary sensors to better suit the needs of the project. Sensors that our team had in mind while going through the project but weren't able to implement included a moisture sensor, water flow sensor, UV distance sensor, and a solenoid valve. Extra time may have given Team 211 a chance to look into making our own custom sensors that would be 

There were also a few problems on the software side of things that I would have liked to been solved. In particular, there was an issue with the value of the IR Sensor analog output to the main subsystem displayed on the LCD not matching the UART print of the same pin from my microcontroller. Our team concluded that this likely due to the travel from one pin to the other through the traces and wires between them. This may have had to be solved by instead programming the microcontroller to output a digital signal when the sensor output reaches a certain range or threshold (empty/not empty based on distance). Internal timers were also an aspect of the project that we unfortunately had not be able to implement due to time constraints, but I believe it would have greatly improved our overall design.

Lastly, one goal I had in mind when first designing the project was creating a physical prototype with limited mechanical function so that we could see the project in action. While this was not included in the scope of the project, it was something that Team 211 wanted to try as practice for EGR 314. Two things slowed down our software and PCB development considerably, however, making us unable to start the development of the physical model. The first was that multiple sensors that were necessary for our original design to function mechanically had daughterboards, and the second was that PCB printing at ASU suddenly became unavailable. These experiences taught me that one should carefully consult the requirements and constraints of the project before creating a design to avoid having to make last minute changes and that, in the future, it may best to order PCBs instead of printing them in house due to their fasting printing and shipping options.
