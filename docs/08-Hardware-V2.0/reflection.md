If I were to create a second version of the design with more time and resources, I would have added more sensors to the subsystem as well as improved the code for my primary and secondary sensors to better suit the needs of the project. Sensors I had in mind while going through the project were several small, automated valves.

Additionally, there was an issue with the value of the IR Sensor analog output to the main subsystem displayed on the LCD not matching the UART print of the same pin from my microcontroller. This would have to be solved by instead programming the microcontroller to output a digital signal when the sensor output reaches a certain range or threshold (empty/not empty based on distance). 

Extra time may have also given me a chance to look into making my own custom sensors
