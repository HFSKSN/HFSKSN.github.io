## Introduction

The purpose of this datasheet is to organize and record the process of planning and constructing my subsystem of Team 211's device using various engineering techniques I have learned from the course EGR 304: Embedded Systems Design Project I. 

### Project Summary

Team 211 is a 4-person team consisting of ASU students Levi A, Hafsa K, Kelton J, and Michael K in the course EGR 304: Embedded Systems Design Project I. The purpose of this project is to create a household device that utilizes simple sensors and actuators to help streamline a process, save resources, or eliminate manual steps. Each student is tasked with designing and producing an electrical subsystem for the device utilizing the knowledge and resources provided by the course. You may review the team's ideation process and full design in the [team report.](https://egr304-2025-f-211.github.io/)

### My Contribution

The device concept decided upon by Team 211 is a small-scale Automated Plant Irrigation System, designed to save water and time as well as to allow people in various situations and living environments to enjoy house plants and home gardens. The role of my subsytem is to monitor the water levels of the external tank that supplies water to the system and send that information to the main board. A simple pressure sensor has also been added to detect and report failures in the system, such as leaks.
