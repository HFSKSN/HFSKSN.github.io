## Introduction

The purpose of this datasheet is to organize and record the process of ideating and constructing my subsystem of Team 211's device using various engineering techniques I have learned from the course EGR 304: Embedded Systems Design Project I. 

### Project Summary

* This needs to be updated to reflect <ins>your version</ins> of the team project, so when shared not via the team's report, the reader gets an idea of the direction of the project and how your work will contribute to the overall success.
* Add context that ties into the link to your [team report.](https://egr304-2025-f-211.github.io/)

### My Contribution

* This needs to be updated to reflect a team introduction
* Content should also help an unfamiliar reader navigate to areas of interest. Information like:
